# Getting started

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Vue.js** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

The stack is built using [vue-cli webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) so to get started all you have to do is:

``` bash
# install dependencies
> npm install
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
> npm run dev
```

Other commands available are:
``` bash
# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run single unit tests
npm run unit

# run continous unit tests
npm run units

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

# To know

Current arbitrary choices are:
- Vuex modules for store
- Vue-axios for ajax requests
- Standard for linting
- 'rwv' as prefix for components

These can be changed when the contributors reach a consensus.
